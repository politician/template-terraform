            As a reminder, you can rebase it either:

            - From your pull request by commenting `/rebase`

            - From your workstation:

              <details>

              Configure upstream if you haven't done so

              ```sh
              git remote add upstream git@github.com:${{github.repository}}.git
              ```

              Ensure you are on your working branch

              ```sh
              git switch <branch_name>
              ```

              Pull upstream and rebase your branch

              ```sh
              git fetch upstream
              git rebase upstream/main
              ```

              Force-push your changes because your branch history has been rewritten

              ```sh
              git push --force origin <branch_name>
              ```

              </details>
